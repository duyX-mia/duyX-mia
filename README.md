.Welcome to my main GitHub account! Here you can find all of my personal projects, as well as the ones I've pulled almost from my school account.
I use this account to showcase my coding skills and interests, and I'm always looking to collaborate on exciting new projects. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out to me if you have any questions or ideas. Thanks for stopping by!

Please note that while I try to keep my GitHub repositories updated, I may not always push code as frequently as I would like. 
This is mainly due to distractions and other commitments in my life. 
However, I am always working on new projects and will do my best to share my progress on this platform. Thank you for understanding and supporting my coding journey!

I am passionate about improving my coding skills and knowledge, i can collaborating with others. I am open to working with both small and large groups on projects that challenge me and push me to learn more.
If you're interested in working together, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow my skills and contribute to exciting projects. Let's build something great together!

I believe that well-written code is essential for creating professional, efficient, and maintainable projects. While I strive to make all of my code as clean and organized as possible, please understand that some of my projects may appear messy or unfinished.

As a "fresher" in the programming world, I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge. Some of my projects may be experimental or serve as a way for me to demonstrate what I have learned so far. (in school)

However, for projects that are intended to be used professionally or by others, I will ensure that "my code" i contribute clean and easy to understand (note the main gist only)

Thank you for taking the time to view my projects and I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have.
